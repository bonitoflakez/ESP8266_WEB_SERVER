# ESP8266_WEB_SERVER

I created this repo to bonk the code that I'm testing on my NodeMCU ESP8266. 
It can create an access point to which you can connect.
Additionally, it runs a web server on that IP address, allowing you to scan for nearby networks and retrieve relevant info.
Furthermore, it has the capability to examine details about devices connected to the access point it generates.
